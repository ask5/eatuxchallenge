            “The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act requires the information on this application. You do not
            have
            to give the information, but if you do not submit all needed information, we cannot approve your child for
            free
            or reduced price meals. You must include the last four digits of the social security number of the adult
            household member who signs the application. The social security number is not required when you apply on
            behalf
            of a foster child or you list a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for
            Needy
            Families (TANF) Program or Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) case number or other

            identifier for your child or when you indicate that the adult household member signing the application does
            not
            have a social security number. We will use your information to determine if your child is eligible for free
            or
            reduced price meals, and for administration and enforcement of the lunch and breakfast programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may share your eligibility information with education, health, and nutrition programs to help them
            evaluate,
            fund, or determine benefits for their programs, auditors for program reviews, and law enforcement officials
            to
            help them look into violations of program rules.”
