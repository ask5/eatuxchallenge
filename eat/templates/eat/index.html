                <h2>National School Lunch Program</h2>
                <p>
                    The National School Lunch Program is a federally assisted meal program operating in public and
                    nonprofit
                    private schools and residential child care institutions. It provides nutritionally balanced,
                    low-cost or
                    free lunches to children each school day. The program was established under the National School
                    Lunch
                    Act, signed by President Harry Truman in 1946.

                    Cafeteria is the nexus of school social life – a place to make friends finish up last night’s
                    homework,
                    refuel for recess, and play tic-tac-toe with your pizza toppings. But for many of America’s
                    schoolchildren, the cafeteria also serves a more essential function – it’s where they receive half
                    or
                    more of their daily nutrition.

                    An overwhelming majority of America’s school children—roughly 50 million elementary and secondary
                    school
                    students—attend institutions that participate in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) school
                    meal
                    programs. Most consume school meals on a regular basis. In total, about 100,000 schools and
                    institutions
                    serve more than five billion meals through the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and two billion
                    via
                    the School Breakfast Program (SBP) to America’s children each school year.
