# E.A.T. School Lunch UX Challenge

This is my entry for the [E.A.T. School Lunch UX Challenge](http://lunchux.devpost.com/)

## Technologies used

### Python Django (Frontend)
Django is a robust [Python Web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com) that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s *free, open source, fast, secure and exceedingly scalable*.

#### Installing Django
Django has an awesome tutorial on how to get started [https://www.djangoproject.com/start/](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/)


### SQLite (Backend)
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is free opensource, self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. In this website it holds all the user and application data. As per the SQLite documentation its pretty robust however for applications like this where the number of records could grow very large, its recomemded to use a powefull RDBMS like Oracle or SQL Server, thankfully in Django it's pretty easy to switch databases.
